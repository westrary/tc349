<h4>Ryan's Bio</h4>
<p>Ryan Westra is a Media Arts and Technology major studying at Michigan State University. From a young age Ryan has been interested in drawing, making flip books, and creating videos. A few years ago, Ryan added a Computer Science minor to his degree when he "discovered" he quite enjoys the technical aspect of design as well. During his Junior year, Ryan worked part time with a new company to incorporate some Flash graphics into the company's website. He is passionate about Jesus Christ, and wants to use his life to serve others and tell them about the gospel. He feels that sitting in front of a computer often can make a person forget about what is important in life, so Ryan enjoys looking at the stars as one way to put things back into perspective.

<h4>Panic.com Critique</h4>
<p>The home page of Panic.com looks beautiful. It is extremely simple which makes it readable and not confusing. They describe who they are in a few short phrases, which is nice, because the first thing I want to know when I'm on a foreign web page is who is the entity that the page represents. The organization of the 5 icons could maybe have been done better. It would be nice if they had 6 applications to show, so they could make two rows of 3 icons. The icons are really large, as is everything on the page, so you can't really see everything in one window. You have to scroll down in order to see all the icons.</p>
<p>Overall, the site is very appealing and does the job. The only other thing I will comment on is the lack of consistency in pages. I understand that application pages can all have a different styles because they are all separate products with different functions. A few of the pages are quite different from the home page though, and it almost makes it seem like I am on a completely different web site. The blog page has its own theme, but I do feel as if I am in a different place.</p>
