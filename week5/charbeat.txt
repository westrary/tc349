Charbeat.com Critique

The site is very flashy and looks nice. I don't have much to complain about except for small details. I'm not a huge fan of having to scroll down the entire page to get a look at all of the content. Some of the graphics are also a little glitchy, like the pixel counter on the bottom makes the whole line glitch back and forth when it changes.
