	<p>This picture is how I sorted the cards. I didn't get a chance to have anyone else do the sorts. The sort I did is similar to how the site is, but not completely the same. The biggest difference is that I put the "Bring Your Foldable to Life" in the "Create" section of the page because I feel like this goes along with creating.</p>
