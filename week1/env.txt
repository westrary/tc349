For now, I've chosen to use the TextMate setup. I'm on a Mac, so I'm using spaces, putting TextMate on one half of the space and the Chrome browser on the other half. On the space one over to the right, I put the terminal. 

I've chosen to use this environment setup over others mostly because TextMate is simpler than other text editors. It's sophisticated enough to use color-coding and indents to organize HTML and CSS elements, but simple enough that it's not an eye sore.

I tested out Dreamweaver as well, and the biggest issue I have against using this is the fact that it looks a lot more complicated. Dreamweaver has many options and buttons in its window, unlike TextMate. Especially since we will be hand-coding pretty much everything in this class, I don't think much of Dreamweaver's functionality will be useful to me.
