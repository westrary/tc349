	<p>I didn't get a chance to have anyone else sort my cards, but the picture above is how I sorted them. Doing a sort for my personal site was actually pretty interesting. I realized that I could group a lot of things into the "About" section, so it amounted to only 4 sections. Some of the content in the "About" section probably wouldn't be super lengthy anyways, so it makes sense to group it together.</p>
