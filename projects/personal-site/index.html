		<p>"It's not who you are underneath. It's what you do that defines you."</p>
		<p>This quote from the movie Batman Begins has great meaning for my life. If I think nice thoughts about those I care about but don't help them in times of need, what is the purpose of these nice thoughts? I know I am nowhere near perfect, but I strive to live out what I believe is right and good and moral.</p>
